# Make Virginia Great '''Again''' For The First Time

### about
"MVAGA" is an open source investigation into Virginia's criminal justice system using the commonwealth's 2015 district court data. This project is still very much a fledgling, and in its current stages soley a means of organizing/analyzing the court data (provided by the site scraping of Ben Schoenfeld https://github.com/bschoenfeld). The goal of this project is to use insights on the readily available data to learn ways we can improve Virginia's justice system. 

Across the country we have a schism between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve, I hope this project can eventually help bridge that divide so we can move forward to tackle bigger issues like equity in opportunity for all peoples.
