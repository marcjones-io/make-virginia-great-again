# Make Virginia Great '''Again''' For The First Time

### about
"MVAGA" is an open source investigation into Virginia's criminal justice system using the commonwealth's 2015 district court data. This project is still very much a fledgling, and in its current stages soley a means of organizing/analyzing the court data (provided by the site scraping of [Ben Schoenfeld](https://github.com/bschoenfeld). The goal of this project is to use insights on the readily available data to learn ways we can improve Virginia's justice system. 

### todo
