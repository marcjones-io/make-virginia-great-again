# Make Virginia Great '''Again''' For The First Time

### about
"MVAGA" is an open source investigation into Virginia's criminal justice system using the commonwealth's district court data. This project is still very much a fledgling, and in its current stages soley a means of organizing/analyzing the court data (provided by the site scraping of [Ben Schoenfeld](https://github.com/bschoenfeld). The goal of this project is to use insights on the readily available data to learn ways we can improve Virginia's justice system. 

### todo
* integrate [numpy](http://www.numpy.org) into project
* use [processing's python mode](http://py.processing.org) to use external graphics visualization
* learn statistics, data science, & analytics

### 2018 updates!
* I have since taken relevant data science courses and am working to incorporate more robust statistical set (derived from this data) into an Android app to help make VA citizens aware of judicial/policing practices (relative to other other counties) based on their geographical location.
